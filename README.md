# notes-app
A simple demo notes app built with JavaScript leveraging local storage to save notes. This project is part of a personal effort to keep learning, set asside frameworks momentarily, and build more things using only Javascript.

## Demo
Working demo is set up here in my [CodePen](https://codepen.io/coysellers/full/zPYvYo/).
